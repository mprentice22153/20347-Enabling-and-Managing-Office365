## Exercise 2: Managing user-driven Office 365 ProPlus installations
  
### Scenario
  
As part of the pilot project, you need to understand the process of installing Office 365 ProPlus directly from the Office 365 portal. You must also explore options for managing the installation. A. Datum Corporation plans to use a combination of user-driven and managed deployments, depending on the employment relationship and working practices of individual users. Associates, those who have brought their own devices, and remote employees will all install Office 365 ProPlus manually from the Office 365 website. Holly, the administrator, will then determine what happens to users when she activates and deactivates Office 365 ProPlus subscriptions. She will also explore the different ways licensing effects the user.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Managing user rights to install Office 365 ProPlus

2. Installing Office 365 ProPlus from the Office 365 portal

3. Managing office licenses

4. Reactivating Office 365 ProPlus
