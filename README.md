# 20347-EnablingAndManagingOffice365



What are we doing?


- To support course 20347 Enabling and Managing Office 365, we will need to make frequent updates to the course content to keep it current with the Office 365 services used in the course. We are publishing the lab instructions and lab files on GitHub to allow for open contributions between the course authors and MCTs to keep the content current with changes in Office 365.

- We hope that this brings a sense of collaboration to the labs like we've never had before - when Office 365 changes and you find it first during a live delivery, go ahead and make an enhancement right in the lab source. Help your fellow MCTs.



How should I use these files relative to the released MOC files?


- The instructor handbook and PowerPoints are still going to be your primary source for teaching the course content.

- These files on GitHub are designed to be used in conjunction with the student handbook, but are in GitHub as a central repository so MCTs and course authors can have a shared source for the latest lab files.

- It will be recommended that for every delivery of 20347, trainers check GitHub for any changes that may have been made to support the latest Azure services, and get the latest files for their delivery.



What about changes to the student handbook?
- We will review the student handbook on a quarterly basis and update through the normal MOC release channels as needed.

**Note:** The lab files on GitHub are intended for MCT use only. Microsoft Learning support for accessing files on GitHub and support for navigation of the GitHub site is limited to MCTs teaching this course only.
